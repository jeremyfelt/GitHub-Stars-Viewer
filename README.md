# GitHub Stars Viewer

I've started to use GitHub as a feed reader or inbox of sorts, and am now following somewhere near 100 repositories (including my own) as a result. The activity from several active projects drowns out one of the most fun parts of GitHubâ€“seeing what other people are starring.

This script provides a very basic view into the recent stars from those that I follow. It's not perfect, as GitHub only allows access to the most recent 300 items from what I can tell. On busy days this may account for 12 or fewer hours of items.

In an attempt to bring more signal from the noise without also making more noise, I may add other events to the script as well including repo creation and user follows.

## How to Go

This is sloppy, but fill in a [personal GitHub access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and your username in the script directly.
